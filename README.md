This is the repository attached to CS-4999-01, my submission for the Computer Science ASP Capstone Thesis, 2024. This repository contains 5 folders
1. FID-calculator
3. GPT-API
4. PathLDM
5. TCGA_stats
6. latent-diffusion

## FID-calculator
This sub-directory corresponds to the standardised synthetic image generation, and model evaluation workflow. 

## GPT-API
This sub-directory corresponds to the created summary generation pipelines.

## PathLDM
This is an adaptation of the original repository of PathLDM, this consists of edits that have been made to the original code in order to better ensure the workability of the code.

## TCGA_stats
This sub-directory consists of the code used to generate the statistics of the different data present in the TCGA-BRCA dataset.

## latent-diffusion
THis is the sub-directory corresponding to the original latent diffusion model, which serves as the inspiration of PathLDM, and our work.


Further details are provided in the individual sub-directories.
